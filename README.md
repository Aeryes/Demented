# Demented
Demented is a game about a young boy who gets lost in a city at night time and must collect money to find his way home. 

The game is built on the Pygame module for Python. Feel free to use any of the code in this game for your own personal projects. No need to ask me, all I ask is that you link my repo somewhere in your project for people to see.
